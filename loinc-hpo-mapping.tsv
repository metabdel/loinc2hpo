Protein [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma	100	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Prothrombin time (PT)	64	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031131	Abnormal plalelet phosphatidylserine exposure	An abnormality of phosphatidylserine (PS) on activated platelets. PS is normally located on the cytoplasmic face of the resting platelet membrane but appears on the plasma-oriented surface of discrete membrane vesicles that derive from activated platelets. Thrombin, the central molecule of coagulation, is produced from prothrombin by a complex (prothrombinase) between factor Xa and its protein cofactor (factor V(a)) that forms on platelet-derived membranes. This complex enhances the rate of activation of prothrombin to thrombin by roughly 150,000 fold relative to factor X(a) in solution. The negatively charged surface of PS-containing platelet-derived membranes is at least partly responsible for this rate enhancement.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Large unstained cells/100 leukocytes in Blood by Automated count	64	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C36207	Digestive System Adenoma	A sporadic or less frequently familial neoplasm, arising from the glandular epithelium of the stomach, small intestine, biliary tract, colon, and rectum.  It is a polypoid or flat circumscribed lesion.  Morphologically, it is characterized by a proliferation of neoplastic glandular cells and it is associated with dysplasia.  According to the growth pattern, it may be classified as tubular, villous, or tubulovillous.  The dysplasia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe.  The frequency of malignant transformation depends on the size of the lesion and the degree of dysplasia.  Larger adenomas with severe dysplastic changes (sometimes called carcinoma in situ) carry a higher risk of progressing to invasive adenocarcinoma. Gastrointestinal adenomas may present as solitary or multifocal lesions.  Familial adenomas tend to be multifocal and carry a higher risk of malignant transformation.

Epithelial cells.squamous [#/area] in Urine sediment by Automated count	80	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C2916	Carcinoma	A malignant tumor arising from epithelial cells. Carcinomas that arise from glandular epithelium are called adenocarcinomas, those that arise from squamous epithelium are called squamous cell carcinomas, and those that arise from transitional epithelium are called transitional cell carcinomas. Morphologically, the malignant epithelial cells may display abnormal mitotic figures, anaplasia, and necrosis. Carcinomas are graded by the degree of cellular differentiation as well, moderately, or poorly differentiated. Carcinomas invade the surrounding tissues and tend to metastasize to other anatomic sites. Lung carcinoma, skin carcinoma, breast carcinoma, colon carcinoma, and prostate carcinoma are the most frequently seen carcinomas.

Prothrombin time (PT) in control Platelet poor plasma by Coagulation assay	64	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031131	Abnormal plalelet phosphatidylserine exposure	An abnormality of phosphatidylserine (PS) on activated platelets. PS is normally located on the cytoplasmic face of the resting platelet membrane but appears on the plasma-oriented surface of discrete membrane vesicles that derive from activated platelets. Thrombin, the central molecule of coagulation, is produced from prothrombin by a complex (prothrombinase) between factor Xa and its protein cofactor (factor V(a)) that forms on platelet-derived membranes. This complex enhances the rate of activation of prothrombin to thrombin by roughly 150,000 fold relative to factor X(a) in solution. The negatively charged surface of PS-containing platelet-derived membranes is at least partly responsible for this rate enhancement.

Microscopic observation [Identifier] in Unspecified specimen by Gram stain	65	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Hepatitis B virus surface Ab [Units/volume] in Serum	90	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

 Parathyrin.intact [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma	85	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030666	Retinal neovascularization	In wound repair, neovascularization (NV) involves the sprouting of new vessels from pre-existent vessels to repair or replace damaged vessels. In the retina, NV is a response to ischemia. The NV adheres to the inner surface of the retina and outer surface of the vitreous. NV are deficient in tight junctions and hence leak plasma into surrounding tissue including the vitreous. Plasma causes the vitreous gel to degenerate, contract, and eventually collapse which pulls on the retina. Since retinal NV is adherent to both retina and vitreous, as the vitreous contracts the NV may be sheared resulting in vitreous hemorrhage or the NV may remain intact and pull the retina with the vitreous resulting in retinal elevation referred to as traction retinal detachment.

ABO and Rh group [Type] in Blood	91	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.
ABO and Rh group [Type] in Blood	71	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3339	Familial Adenomatous Polyposis	An autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by the presence of multiple adenomas in the colon and rectum. It is caused by a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene which is located on the long arm of chromosome 5. The adenomas are most often tubular, and they have the tendency to progress to adenocarcinoma. They can occur throughout the colon, but they tend to concentrate in the rectum and sigmoid colon. The colorectal adenomas are detected during endoscopic examination between the age of 10 and 20 years. The adenomas increase in size and numbers with age, and there is usually progression of one or more adenomas to adenocarcinoma. The mean age of development of adenocarcinoma is about 40 years. Signs include rectal bleeding and mucousy diarrhea.

Thrombin, the central molecule of coagulation, is produced from prothrombin by a complex (prothrombinase) between factor Xa and its protein cofactor (factor V(a)) that forms on platelet-derived membranes. This complex enhances the rate of activation of prothrombin to thrombin by roughly 150,000 fold relative to factor X(a) in solution. The negatively charged surface of PS-containing platelet-derived membranes is at least partly responsible for this rate enhancement.

Protein [Mass/volume] in Cerebral spinal fluid	80	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Protein [Mass/volume] in Cerebral spinal fluid	80	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030780	Abnormality of the protein C anticoagulant pathway	An anomaly of the protein C anticoagulant pathway, which serves as a major system for controlling thrombosis, limiting inflammatory responses, and potentially decreasing endothelial cell apoptosis in response to inflammatory cytokines and ischemia. A natural anticoagulant system denoted the protein C pathway exerts its anticoagulant effect by regulating the activity of FVIIIa and FVa. The vitamin K-dependent protein C is the key component of the pathway. Activated protein C (APC) cleaves and inhibits coagulation cofactors FVIIIa and FVa, which result in downregulation of the activity of the coagulation system. The endothelial protein C receptor stimulates the T-TM-mediated activation of protein C on the endothelial cell surface. The two cofactors, protein S and the intact form of FV, enhance the anticoagulant activity of APC.

Hepatitis B virus core IgM Ab [Presence] in Serum or Plasma by Immunoassay	84	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Protein [Mass/volume] in Body fluid	80	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030780	Abnormality of the protein C anticoagulant pathway	An anomaly of the protein C anticoagulant pathway, which serves as a major system for controlling thrombosis, limiting inflammatory responses, and potentially decreasing endothelial cell apoptosis in response to inflammatory cytokines and ischemia. A natural anticoagulant system denoted the protein C pathway exerts its anticoagulant effect by regulating the activity of FVIIIa and FVa. The vitamin K-dependent protein C is the key component of the pathway. Activated protein C (APC) cleaves and inhibits coagulation cofactors FVIIIa and FVa, which result in downregulation of the activity of the coagulation system. The endothelial protein C receptor stimulates the T-TM-mediated activation of protein C on the endothelial cell surface. The two cofactors, protein S and the intact form of FV, enhance the anticoagulant activity of APC.

Coagulation factor VIII activity actual/normal in Platelet poor plasma by Coagulation assay	74	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030780	Abnormality of the protein C anticoagulant pathway	An anomaly of the protein C anticoagulant pathway, which serves as a major system for controlling thrombosis, limiting inflammatory responses, and potentially decreasing endothelial cell apoptosis in response to inflammatory cytokines and ischemia. A natural anticoagulant system denoted the protein C pathway exerts its anticoagulant effect by regulating the activity of FVIIIa and FVa. The vitamin K-dependent protein C is the key component of the pathway. Activated protein C (APC) cleaves and inhibits coagulation cofactors FVIIIa and FVa, which result in downregulation of the activity of the coagulation system. The endothelial protein C receptor stimulates the T-TM-mediated activation of protein C on the endothelial cell surface. The two cofactors, protein S and the intact form of FV, enhance the anticoagulant activity of APC.

Hepatitis A virus IgM Ab [Presence] in Serum or Plasma by Immunoassay	90	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Except for IL-17B, all other IL-17 family members are homodimers containing five highly conserved cysteine residues forming characteristic cystein-knot structure, similar to that found in the TGF-beta-like cystine-knot (PR:000000008). This class consists of six cytokines. Among them, interleukin 17A (IL-17) and IL-17F are expressed by a novel subset of CD4+ helper T (Th) cells and play a critical role in inflammation and autoimmunity. On the other hand, IL-17E, also called IL-25, has been associated with allergic responses.
Protein [Mass/time] in 24 hour Urine	80	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Protein [Mass/time] in 24 hour Urine	80	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030780	Abnormality of the protein C anticoagulant pathway	An anomaly of the protein C anticoagulant pathway, which serves as a major system for controlling thrombosis, limiting inflammatory responses, and potentially decreasing endothelial cell apoptosis in response to inflammatory cytokines and ischemia. A natural anticoagulant system denoted the protein C pathway exerts its anticoagulant effect by regulating the activity of FVIIIa and FVa. The vitamin K-dependent protein C is the key component of the pathway. Activated protein C (APC) cleaves and inhibits coagulation cofactors FVIIIa and FVa, which result in downregulation of the activity of the coagulation system. The endothelial protein C receptor stimulates the T-TM-mediated activation of protein C on the endothelial cell surface. The two cofactors, protein S and the intact form of FV, enhance the anticoagulant activity of APC.

Alpha-1-Fetoprotein [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma	100	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Thyroperoxidase Ab [Units/volume] in Serum or Plasma	85	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Cryptococcus sp Ag [Titer] in Serum by Latex agglutination	90	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Cryptococcus sp Ag [Titer] in Serum by Latex agglutination	90	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031131	Abnormal plalelet phosphatidylserine exposure	An abnormality of phosphatidylserine (PS) on activated platelets. PS is normally located on the cytoplasmic face of the resting platelet membrane but appears on the plasma-oriented surface of discrete membrane vesicles that derive from activated platelets. Thrombin, the central molecule of coagulation, is produced from prothrombin by a complex (prothrombinase) between factor Xa and its protein cofactor (factor V(a)) that forms on platelet-derived membranes. This complex enhances the rate of activation of prothrombin to thrombin by roughly 150,000 fold relative to factor X(a) in solution. The negatively charged surface of PS-containing platelet-derived membranes is at least partly responsible for this rate enhancement.

Color of Spun Cerebral spinal fluid	80	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3339	Familial Adenomatous Polyposis	An autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by the presence of multiple adenomas in the colon and rectum. It is caused by a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene which is located on the long arm of chromosome 5. The adenomas are most often tubular, and they have the tendency to progress to adenocarcinoma. They can occur throughout the colon, but they tend to concentrate in the rectum and sigmoid colon. The colorectal adenomas are detected during endoscopic examination between the age of 10 and 20 years. The adenomas increase in size and numbers with age, and there is usually progression of one or more adenomas to adenocarcinoma. The mean age of development of adenocarcinoma is about 40 years. Signs include rectal bleeding and mucousy diarrhea.

Johnson grass smut IgE Ab [Units/volume] in Serum	68	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031545	Abnormally low T-cell receptor excision circle level	Reduced level of T-cell receptor excision circle (TRECs) as measured by the TREC assay. Late in maturation, 70% of thymocytes that will ultimately express alpha/beta-T cell receptors form a circular DNA TREC from the excised TCRdelta gene that lies within the TCRalpha genetic locus. The circles are stable but do not increase following cell division and, therefore, become diluted as T cells proliferate. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction across the joint of the circular DNA provides the TREC copy number, a marker of newly-formed, antigenically-naïve thymic emigrant T cells.
Deprecated Common Ragweed IgE Ab [Units/volume] in Serum	82	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Ova and parasites identified in Unspecified specimen by Light microscopy	70	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030666	Retinal neovascularization	In wound repair, neovascularization (NV) involves the sprouting of new vessels from pre-existent vessels to repair or replace damaged vessels. In the retina, NV is a response to ischemia. The NV adheres to the inner surface of the retina and outer surface of the vitreous. NV are deficient in tight junctions and hence leak plasma into surrounding tissue including the vitreous. Plasma causes the vitreous gel to degenerate, contract, and eventually collapse which pulls on the retina. Since retinal NV is adherent to both retina and vitreous, as the vitreous contracts the NV may be sheared resulting in vitreous hemorrhage or the NV may remain intact and pull the retina with the vitreous resulting in retinal elevation referred to as traction retinal detachment.

Prothrombin activity actual/normal in Platelet poor plasma by Coagulation assay	60	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031131	Abnormal plalelet phosphatidylserine exposure	An abnormality of phosphatidylserine (PS) on activated platelets. PS is normally located on the cytoplasmic face of the resting platelet membrane but appears on the plasma-oriented surface of discrete membrane vesicles that derive from activated platelets. Thrombin, the central molecule of coagulation, is produced from prothrombin by a complex (prothrombinase) between factor Xa and its protein cofactor (factor V(a)) that forms on platelet-derived membranes. This complex enhances the rate of activation of prothrombin to thrombin by roughly 150,000 fold relative to factor X(a) in solution. The negatively charged surface of PS-containing platelet-derived membranes is at least partly responsible for this rate enhancement.
Prothrombin activity actual/normal in Platelet poor plasma by Coagulation assay	60	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0003337	Reduced prothrombin consumption	The prothrombin consumption test measures the formation of intrinsic thromboplastin by determining the residual serum prothrombin after blood clotting is complete. If there is a defect in the process, less prothrombin will be converted to thrombin than normal (less prothrombin is consumed). This test may be abnormal with conditions including deficiency of factors VIII or IX, with circulating anticoagulants, thrombocytopenia.

Alpha 1 antitrypsin [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma	85	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

The vitamin K-dependent protein C is the key component of the pathway. Activated protein C (APC) cleaves and inhibits coagulation cofactors FVIIIa and FVa, which result in downregulation of the activity of the coagulation system. The endothelial protein C receptor stimulates the T-TM-mediated activation of protein C on the endothelial cell surface. The two cofactors, protein S and the intact form of FV, enhance the anticoagulant activity of APC.

There are many ways of assessing lactase activity. In one test, an endoscopic biopsy from the postbulbar duodenum is incubated with lactose on a test plate, and a color reaction develops within 20 min as a result of hydrolyzed lactose (a positive result) in patients with normolactasia, whereas no reaction (a negative result) develops in patients with severe hypolactasia. Other, less direct, tests include the hydrogen breath test, and blood tests following lactose challenges.

Protein S actual/normal in Platelet poor plasma by Coagulation assay	65	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

As the most common primary tumor of the eye in children, retinoblastoma is still relatively uncommon, accounting for only 1% of all malignant tumors in pediatric patients. Approximately 95% of cases are diagnosed before age 5. These tumors may be multifocal, bilateral, congenital, inherited, or acquired. Seventy-five percent of retinoblastomas are unilateral; 60% occur sporadically. A predisposition to retinoblastoma has been associated with 13q14 cytogenetic abnormalities. Patients with the inherited form also appear to be at increased risk for secondary nonocular malignancies such as osteosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and fibrosarcoma.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Microscopically, it is characterized by frequently open vascular anastomosing and branching channels.  The malignant cells that line the vascular channels are spindle or epithelioid and often display hyperchromatic nuclei.  Angiosarcomas most frequently occur in the skin and breast.  Patients with long-standing lymphedema are at increased risk of developing angiosarcoma.
CD45 (Lymphs) cells/100 cells in Blood	95	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

This state of transfusion causes the donor twin to have decreased blood volume, retarding the donor's development and growth. The blood volume of the recipient twin is increased, which can strain the fetus's heart and eventually lead to heart failure.

Sjogrens syndrome-A extractable nuclear IgG Ab [Presence] in Serum by Immunoassay	60	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002639	Budd-Chiari syndrome	Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is caused by obstruction of hepatic venous outflow at any level from the small hepatic veins to the junction of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with the right atrium, 1 and occurs in 1/100,000 of the general population worldwide. The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms. Obstruction of hepatic venous outflow is mainly caused by primary intravascular thrombosis, which can occur suddenly or be repeated over time, accompanied by some revascularization, accounting for the variable parenchymal hepatic damage and histologic presentation. Budd-Chiari syndrome is thus a disease, but since it occurs as a manifestation of several other diseases, this term is kept for the present for convenience.

Cryptococcus sp Ag [Titer] in Cerebral spinal fluid by Latex agglutination	70	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3403	Teratoma	A non-seminomatous germ cell tumor characterized by the presence of various tissues which correspond to the different germinal layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm). It occurs in the testis, ovary, and extragonadal sites including central nervous system, mediastinum, lung, and stomach. According to the level of differentiation of the tissues which comprise the tumor, teratomas are classified as mature or immature. Mature teratomas are composed of well differentiated, adult-type tissues. Immature teratomas are composed of immature, fetal-type tissues. Testicular teratomas in children follow a benign clinical course. Mature ovarian teratomas without a fetal-type component have an excellent outcome. The prognosis of immature ovarian teratomas is related to the grade and stage of the tumor.

Cutaneous melanomas may arise from acquired or congenital melanocytic or dysplastic nevi. Melanomas may also arise in other anatomic sites including the gastrointestinal system, eye, urinary tract, and reproductive system. Melanomas frequently metastasize to lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and brain.
Cryptococcus sp Ag [Titer] in Cerebral spinal fluid by Latex agglutination	70	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Protein C [Units/volume] in Platelet poor plasma by Coagulation assay	80	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months.

Protein C [Units/volume] in Platelet poor plasma by Coagulation assay	80	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030780	Abnormality of the protein C anticoagulant pathway	An anomaly of the protein C anticoagulant pathway, which serves as a major system for controlling thrombosis, limiting inflammatory responses, and potentially decreasing endothelial cell apoptosis in response to inflammatory cytokines and ischemia. A natural anticoagulant system denoted the protein C pathway exerts its anticoagulant effect by regulating the activity of FVIIIa and FVa. The vitamin K-dependent protein C is the key component of the pathway. Activated protein C (APC) cleaves and inhibits coagulation cofactors FVIIIa and FVa, which result in downregulation of the activity of the coagulation system. The endothelial protein C receptor stimulates the T-TM-mediated activation of protein C on the endothelial cell surface. The two cofactors, protein S and the intact form of FV, enhance the anticoagulant activity of APC.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Acetylcholine receptor modulation Ab/Acetylcholine Ab.total in Serum	65	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030780	Abnormality of the protein C anticoagulant pathway	An anomaly of the protein C anticoagulant pathway, which serves as a major system for controlling thrombosis, limiting inflammatory responses, and potentially decreasing endothelial cell apoptosis in response to inflammatory cytokines and ischemia. A natural anticoagulant system denoted the protein C pathway exerts its anticoagulant effect by regulating the activity of FVIIIa and FVa. The vitamin K-dependent protein C is the key component of the pathway. Activated protein C (APC) cleaves and inhibits coagulation cofactors FVIIIa and FVa, which result in downregulation of the activity of the coagulation system. The endothelial protein C receptor stimulates the T-TM-mediated activation of protein C on the endothelial cell surface. The two cofactors, protein S and the intact form of FV, enhance the anticoagulant activity of APC.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Corynebacterium diphtheriae Ab [Units/volume] in Serum by Immunoassay	80	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Thyrotropin receptor Ab [Units/volume] in Serum	70	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030780	Abnormality of the protein C anticoagulant pathway	An anomaly of the protein C anticoagulant pathway, which serves as a major system for controlling thrombosis, limiting inflammatory responses, and potentially decreasing endothelial cell apoptosis in response to inflammatory cytokines and ischemia. A natural anticoagulant system denoted the protein C pathway exerts its anticoagulant effect by regulating the activity of FVIIIa and FVa. The vitamin K-dependent protein C is the key component of the pathway. Activated protein C (APC) cleaves and inhibits coagulation cofactors FVIIIa and FVa, which result in downregulation of the activity of the coagulation system. The endothelial protein C receptor stimulates the T-TM-mediated activation of protein C on the endothelial cell surface. The two cofactors, protein S and the intact form of FV, enhance the anticoagulant activity of APC.

A natural anticoagulant system denoted the protein C pathway exerts its anticoagulant effect by regulating the activity of FVIIIa and FVa. The vitamin K-dependent protein C is the key component of the pathway. Activated protein C (APC) cleaves and inhibits coagulation cofactors FVIIIa and FVa, which result in downregulation of the activity of the coagulation system. The endothelial protein C receptor stimulates the T-TM-mediated activation of protein C on the endothelial cell surface. The two cofactors, protein S and the intact form of FV, enhance the anticoagulant activity of APC.

Acetylcholine receptor ganglionic neuronal Ab [Moles/volume] in Serum	62	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031545	Abnormally low T-cell receptor excision circle level	Reduced level of T-cell receptor excision circle (TRECs) as measured by the TREC assay. Late in maturation, 70% of thymocytes that will ultimately express alpha/beta-T cell receptors form a circular DNA TREC from the excised TCRdelta gene that lies within the TCRalpha genetic locus. The circles are stable but do not increase following cell division and, therefore, become diluted as T cells proliferate. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction across the joint of the circular DNA provides the TREC copy number, a marker of newly-formed, antigenically-naïve thymic emigrant T cells.

Prothrombin time (PT) factor substitution in Platelet poor plasma by Coagulation assay --immediately after addition of normal plasma	66	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0031131	Abnormal plalelet phosphatidylserine exposure	An abnormality of phosphatidylserine (PS) on activated platelets. PS is normally located on the cytoplasmic face of the resting platelet membrane but appears on the plasma-oriented surface of discrete membrane vesicles that derive from activated platelets. Thrombin, the central molecule of coagulation, is produced from prothrombin by a complex (prothrombinase) between factor Xa and its protein cofactor (factor V(a)) that forms on platelet-derived membranes. This complex enhances the rate of activation of prothrombin to thrombin by roughly 150,000 fold relative to factor X(a) in solution. The negatively charged surface of PS-containing platelet-derived membranes is at least partly responsible for this rate enhancement.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Protein S Free [Units/volume] in Platelet poor plasma by Coagulation assay	65	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030780	Abnormality of the protein C anticoagulant pathway	An anomaly of the protein C anticoagulant pathway, which serves as a major system for controlling thrombosis, limiting inflammatory responses, and potentially decreasing endothelial cell apoptosis in response to inflammatory cytokines and ischemia. A natural anticoagulant system denoted the protein C pathway exerts its anticoagulant effect by regulating the activity of FVIIIa and FVa. The vitamin K-dependent protein C is the key component of the pathway. Activated protein C (APC) cleaves and inhibits coagulation cofactors FVIIIa and FVa, which result in downregulation of the activity of the coagulation system. The endothelial protein C receptor stimulates the T-TM-mediated activation of protein C on the endothelial cell surface. The two cofactors, protein S and the intact form of FV, enhance the anticoagulant activity of APC.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Hepatitis B virus surface Ag [Presence] in Serum or Plasma by Neutralization test	90	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Rh [Type] in Blood	100	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002249	Melena	The passage of blackish, tarry feces associated with gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Melena occurs if the blood remains in the colon long enough for it to be broken down by colonic bacteria. One degradation product, hematin, imbues the stool with a blackish color. Thus, melena generally occurs with bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract (e.g., sotmach ulcers or duodenal ulcers), since the blood usually remains in the gut for a longer period of time than with lower gastrointestinal bleeding.

Rh [Type] in Blood	100	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030666	Retinal neovascularization	In wound repair, neovascularization (NV) involves the sprouting of new vessels from pre-existent vessels to repair or replace damaged vessels. In the retina, NV is a response to ischemia. The NV adheres to the inner surface of the retina and outer surface of the vitreous. NV are deficient in tight junctions and hence leak plasma into surrounding tissue including the vitreous. Plasma causes the vitreous gel to degenerate, contract, and eventually collapse which pulls on the retina. Since retinal NV is adherent to both retina and vitreous, as the vitreous contracts the NV may be sheared resulting in vitreous hemorrhage or the NV may remain intact and pull the retina with the vitreous resulting in retinal elevation referred to as traction retinal detachment.

Cryptosporidium sp Ag [Presence] in Stool by Immunoassay	70	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C7541	Retinoblastoma	A malignant tumor that originates in the nuclear layer of the retina. As the most common primary tumor of the eye in children, retinoblastoma is still relatively uncommon, accounting for only 1% of all malignant tumors in pediatric patients. Approximately 95% of cases are diagnosed before age 5. These tumors may be multifocal, bilateral, congenital, inherited, or acquired. Seventy-five percent of retinoblastomas are unilateral; 60% occur sporadically. A predisposition to retinoblastoma has been associated with 13q14 cytogenetic abnormalities. Patients with the inherited form also appear to be at increased risk for secondary nonocular malignancies such as osteosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and fibrosarcoma.

It occurs in the testis, ovary, and extragonadal sites including central nervous system, mediastinum, lung, and stomach. According to the level of differentiation of the tissues which comprise the tumor, teratomas are classified as mature or immature. Mature teratomas are composed of well differentiated, adult-type tissues. Immature teratomas are composed of immature, fetal-type tissues. Testicular teratomas in children follow a benign clinical course. Mature ovarian teratomas without a fetal-type component have an excellent outcome. The prognosis of immature ovarian teratomas is related to the grade and stage of the tumor.

Most often, melanomas arise in the skin (cutaneous melanomas) and include the following histologic subtypes: superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma, and lentigo maligna melanoma. Cutaneous melanomas may arise from acquired or congenital melanocytic or dysplastic nevi. Melanomas may also arise in other anatomic sites including the gastrointestinal system, eye, urinary tract, and reproductive system. Melanomas frequently metastasize to lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and brain.
Cryptosporidium sp Ag [Presence] in Stool by Immunoassay	70	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Cryptosporidium sp Ag [Presence] in Stool by Immunoassay	70	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0030780	Abnormality of the protein C anticoagulant pathway	An anomaly of the protein C anticoagulant pathway, which serves as a major system for controlling thrombosis, limiting inflammatory responses, and potentially decreasing endothelial cell apoptosis in response to inflammatory cytokines and ischemia. A natural anticoagulant system denoted the protein C pathway exerts its anticoagulant effect by regulating the activity of FVIIIa and FVa. The vitamin K-dependent protein C is the key component of the pathway. Activated protein C (APC) cleaves and inhibits coagulation cofactors FVIIIa and FVa, which result in downregulation of the activity of the coagulation system. The endothelial protein C receptor stimulates the T-TM-mediated activation of protein C on the endothelial cell surface. The two cofactors, protein S and the intact form of FV, enhance the anticoagulant activity of APC.

Alpha-2-Macroglobulin [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma	85	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Glucose [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma --1 hour post 50 g glucose PO	100	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0025130	Decreased small intestinal mucosa lactase activity@en	Lactase is produced in the small intestine in humans, Lactase is a member of the beta-galactosidase family of enzymes, and hydrolyzes D-lactose to form D-galactose and D-glucose, which can be absorbed by the small intestine. There are many ways of assessing lactase activity. In one test, an endoscopic biopsy from the postbulbar duodenum is incubated with lactose on a test plate, and a color reaction develops within 20 min as a result of hydrolyzed lactose (a positive result) in patients with normolactasia, whereas no reaction (a negative result) develops in patients with severe hypolactasia. Other, less direct, tests include the hydrogen breath test, and blood tests following lactose challenges.

Hepatitis A virus Ab [Presence] in Serum by Immunoassay	100	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

Coxsackievirus B6 Ab [Units/volume] in Serum	80	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C3099	Hepatocellular Carcinoma	A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

It is a polypoid or flat circumscribed lesion.  Morphologically, it is characterized by a proliferation of neoplastic glandular cells and it is associated with dysplasia.  According to the growth pattern, it may be classified as tubular, villous, or tubulovillous.  The dysplasia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe.  The frequency of malignant transformation depends on the size of the lesion and the degree of dysplasia.  Larger adenomas with severe dysplastic changes (sometimes called carcinoma in situ) carry a higher risk of progressing to invasive adenocarcinoma. Gastrointestinal adenomas may present as solitary or multifocal lesions.  Familial adenomas tend to be multifocal and carry a higher risk of malignant transformation.

Reptilase time	65	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0002639	Budd-Chiari syndrome	Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is caused by obstruction of hepatic venous outflow at any level from the small hepatic veins to the junction of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with the right atrium, 1 and occurs in 1/100,000 of the general population worldwide. The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms. Obstruction of hepatic venous outflow is mainly caused by primary intravascular thrombosis, which can occur suddenly or be repeated over time, accompanied by some revascularization, accounting for the variable parenchymal hepatic damage and histologic presentation. Budd-Chiari syndrome is thus a disease, but since it occurs as a manifestation of several other diseases, this term is kept for the present for convenience.

The HbA1c level provides a better indication of long-term glycemic control than one-time blood or urinary glucose measurements.
Reptilase time	65	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_0004348	Abnormality of bone mineral density	This term applies to all changes in bone mineral density which (depending on severity) can be seen on x-rays as a change in density and or structure of the bone. Changes may affect all bones of the organism, just certain bones or only parts of bones and include decreased mineralisation as may be seen in osteoporosis or increased mineralisation and or ossification as in osteopetrosis, exostoses or any kind of atopic calicfications of different origin and distribution. The overall amount of mineralization of the bone-organ can be measured as the amount of matter per cubic centimeter of bones, usually measured by densitometry of the lumbar spine or hip. The measurements are usually reported as g/cm3 or as a Z-score (the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for the patient's age and sex). Note that measurement with this method does not reflect local changes in other bones, and as such might not be correct with regard the hole bone-organ.
